I was been alotted with some python tasks and I am sharing the description of the tasks here. 

Task 1 (To-Do list)
To Develop a To-Do list application in Python that provides users with a convenient way to manage their tasks. The application can be implemented using either a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). It should allow users to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and tracking tasks.

Task 2 (Simple Calculator)
To Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display the result.

Tas3 (PASSWORD GENERATOR)

A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password. Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

TASK 4 (Rock-Paper-Scissors Game)

User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.
Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie. Score Tracking (Optional): Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.
Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedbacks.
